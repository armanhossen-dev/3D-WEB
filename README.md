# 🌐 3D Website with HTML, CSS, Spline & AOS

Welcome to my 3D Website project! This site is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and integrated with **Spline** to create a visually stunning 3D experience right in the browser. It also uses **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** to add smooth scroll-based animations for a more engaging experience.

This project is based on the YouTube tutorial [**Build a Stunning 3D Website with HTML, CSS & Spline!**](https://youtu.be/oskiEydAaok?si=_PDZ1cx8bEEJfFjX) by **Online Tutorials**.
